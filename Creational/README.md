## Creational

These patterns are designed for class instantiation. 
They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

- **Abstract Factory:** Creates an instance of several families of classes.


- **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation.


- **Factory Method:** Creates an instance of several derived classes.


- **Prototype:** A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.


- **Singleton:** A class of which only a single instance can exist.
