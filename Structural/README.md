## Structural 

These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition.
The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

- **Adapter:** Match interfaces of different classes

- **Bridge:** Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

- **Composite:** A tree structure of simple and composite objects

- **Decorator:** Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

- **Facade:** A single class that represents an entire subsystem

- **Flyweight:** A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

- **Proxy:** An object representing another object
